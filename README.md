# GreenWhale 2022
My second team project in tech industry. I was mainly responsible for all graphic and video work as well as for web page design and functionality.

"Project aims to design, create, and actively operate a remotely controlled cleaning robot for Polish stagnant water reservoirs. Waste collection, remote control, and even active eco-power supplyâ€”all in one spirited robot!"

We have raised over 3,407 PLN for the project and reached approximately 3,897 beneficiaries.

## Prizes:
- ### ðŸ¥ˆ Best Project in Subcarpathian Voivodeship 2022

## Long description

"The environmental pollution problem is significantly worsening year after year. Places that have been our home for millennia are being transformed into massive garbage dumps, and water bodies that sustain all living organisms have never been more polluted in history. It's hard to describe this situation other than with the word 'disaster.' Contrary to the opinions of many, Poland's freshwater resources are genuinely limited. According to reports from 'gov.pl,' Poland is grappling with one of the largest shortages of renewable freshwater in the European Union. Our indicator is only 1,600 m3 per capitaâ€”by comparison, in Croatia, it's 28,800 m3. Statistics show that by 2050, water demand will increase by over 50%, and more than 40% of people may experience its scarcity. Our team has decided to preempt these alarming forecasts and show the world a new, cleaner face of precious freshwater reservoirs."
